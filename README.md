# RxJS learning with-jest-marbles

Welcome to the RxJS Learning Repository with Jest-marbles! This repository is designed to facilitate the learning and mastering of RxJS, a powerful library for reactive programming using Observables, through hands-on practice with Jest-marbles.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of tests that leverage Jest-marbles, a testing library for marble diagrams. Marble diagrams are a visual way to represent and understand the behavior of Observables in RxJS, making them an excellent tool for learning and testing reactive code.

## Features

- **Marble Testing Examples**: Detailed examples of marble testing to demonstrate how to test RxJS streams effectively.

- **Best Practices**: Guidance on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable reactive code with RxJS.

- **Interactive Learning**: Encourages learning by doing, with hands-on examples and exercises.

## Getting Started

- **Clone the Repository**:

```console
git clone https://github.com/nagyattis81/rxjs-learning
cd rxjs-learning
```

- **Install Dependencies**:

```console
npm i
```

- **Run Tests**:

```console
npm t
```

## Directory Structure

- **\_\_tests\_\_**: Contains the Jest-marbles test cases.

## Learning Path

- **Introduction to Observables**: Learn the basics of Observables and how they work.
- **Operators**: Dive into various RxJS operators and their applications.
- **Marble Diagrams**: Understand marble diagrams and how to use them for visualizing streams.
- **Testing with Jest-marbles**: Write tests for your Observables using Jest-marbles.
